The explanation of Discrete Log Contracts is available at https://scalingbitcoin.org/stanford2017/Day1/DryjaDLCscaling.pdf and https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf.

This implementation uses the https://github.com/chainside/btcpy library with Python 3.3.

The programming for Schnorr Signatures is from   Dr. Orion Lawlor https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2015/spring/cs463/lecture/03_25_signature/schnorr.py
